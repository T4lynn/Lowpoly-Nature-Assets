-=-=-=-=-=README FOR PREFABS=-=-=-=-=-=-

- These prefabs are set up for LOD
(Level Of Detail).

- That means they're ready to go for
unity's built in terrain tools! 

- This is what the lower poly versions
of the trees are for. 

- If you don't want to use Unity's 
terrain tools or don't need LOD, you can
ignore these prefabs!
